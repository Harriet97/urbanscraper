<h1>UrbanScraper <span class="smallcaps">an API for Urban Dictionary</span></h1>

<p>UrbanScraper implements a simple API for accessing 
<a href="http://urbandictionary.com/">Urban Dictionary</a>. 
<a href="http://nickcharlton.net/">Nick Charlton</a> built this to get 
definitions through <a href="http://alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: This was built because Urban Dictionary don't have their own API. 
       To make it work, this relies on screen scraping. If you don't get a result 
       when you should, something has probably changed.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The possible methods are below. Currently you can only get the first definition 
of a word.</p>

<h3>Route</h3>

<p><code>GET /define/term.json</code></p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p><code><pre>
{
   "timestamp":1319831727,
   "word":"zomg",
   "url":"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zomg",
   "definition":"zOMG is a varient of the all-too-popular acronym \"OMG\"",
   "status":200
}
</pre></code></p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the definition of a given term. Returns a status code of 404 if the term 
is invalid. The order of the JSON isn't guaranteed. The timestamp represents when 
it was last fetched.</p>

<p>A little bit of caching is done on my side to keep the hits to Urban Dictionary 
down, but even then, please don't abuse it. They probably wouldn't like it.</p>
